What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository it enables git tracking and features in the directory it was 
initialized(git init). You need it to use git and all it's features.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is different from the working directory because the file(s) are being tracked and basically ready to be pushed/committed to git. It differs from the repository since it's an in-between area where files go before the repository if they are ready to be pushed to the repo. 
The staging area offers great value to track changes made to the files before they are committed to a repo/production ready environment.
